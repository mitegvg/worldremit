Hi Dimitar,
I hope all is well.
My name is Shon and I work at Cyberint, a cyber threat intelligence company.
I’m reaching out to you on behalf of our client, WorldRemit.

Our client has encountered your GitHub repository - https://github.com/mitegvg/worldremit/
While we understand the repository wasn’t intended to harm WorldRemit or its customers, WorldRemit has concerns regarding the potential brand abuse aspect of this repository.
As such, we are reaching out to you and kindly request you to limit the access for this repository (i.e set it as private), or better yet, remove it from GitHub entirely.

We would greatly appreciate your understanding and cooperation regarding this matter.
